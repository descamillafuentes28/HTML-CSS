    <h1>How S. Bronx Bodegas Can Implement Healthy Eats</h1>

    <h2>Bodega owners and managers want to include a better-curated selection of products, however, they are met with drawbacks.</h2>

<p>In the Bronx, bodegas offer more than food and home essentials, they are perceived as a place “where all languages and people converge and a culture is passed from one generation of New Yorkers to the next,” writes Charlie Velazquez for Electric Literature.</p>

<p>“Healthy Corner Stores is a proposal for a pilot project that will be based in Hunts Point and that would make it easier for bodega owners in Hunts Point to stock healthy, affordable, food,” said Divya Subramanian, Associate Director at the New York University's Stern Center for Sustainable Businesss.</p>

<p>“Bodega, we don’t have a lot of healthy, and healthy is more expensive,” said bodega owner, Lee Zheng, 36.</p> 

<p>In a survey, for the Healthy Corner Stores’ project, conducted at the Hunts Point Back-to-School Fair, children were presented with a variety of healthy snack options, the response was positive.</p>

<p>The Healthy Corner Stores’ project focuses on a successful supply and demand model that bodega owners can continue to use, even after the research is finalized. The hope is that the project becomes a permanent solution.</p>

        <p>While bodegas exist in large quantities and play a significant role in the lives of those who frequent them, recurring observations describe them as “underutilized sources of healthy food,” New York University’s Center for Sustainable Business writes.</p>
